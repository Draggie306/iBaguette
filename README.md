iBaguette.com is my first website. This repo serves to host the core content and HTML that comprises the site.

## Summary
iBaguette is a UK-based open-source and privacy-centric website that offers various resources and tools to improve users' lives. It provides popular and effective GCSE and A-level revision cheat sheets, coding challenges, and other revision resources for subjects such as French vocabulary, geography, biology, and sciences. 
Additionally, it has quick links and a platform to discover other well-reputed revision resources, including maths, physics, and chemistry. Users can also access open-source development guidance, games development projects, Minecraft servers, an open-source desktop application called DraggieTools, a technical blog, and a public API for developers. The site also provides information about the owner's YouTube channel, including polls and the latest video uploads.

iBaguette's Cheat Sheet page is available in another repo, as this is not a core part of the site, but rather an extension. It is available at https://github.com/Draggie306/CheatSheets.
