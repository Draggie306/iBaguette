iBaguette.com is my first website. This repo serves to host the core content and HTML that comprises the site.

## Summary
iBaguette is a UK-based open-source and privacy-centric website that offers various resources and tools to improve YOUR life! It provides popular and effective GCSE and A-level revision cheat sheets, coding challenges, and other revision resources for subjects such as French vocabulary, geography, biology, and sciences. 

Additionally, it has quick links and a platform to discover other well-reputed revision resources, including Maths, Physics, Chemistry and History, written, validated by and critiques by students and teachers. Users can also access open-source development guidance, games development projects, Minecraft servers, open-source desktop applications such as DraggieTools, a technical blog, and a public API for developers!

iBaguette's Cheat Sheet page is available in another repo, as this is not a core part of the site, but rather an extension. It is available at https://github.com/Draggie306/CheatSheets.
