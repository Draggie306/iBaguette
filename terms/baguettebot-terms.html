<p>The owner of <a href="http://iBaguette.com">iBaguette.com</a> and BaguetteBot cannot guarantee that the Bot will always be available, uninterrupted, or error-free.

<h2 id="governing-law">Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

You waive any right to assert any claims against the owner of <a href="http://iBaguette.com">iBaguette.com</a> or BaguetteBot as a representative or member in any class or representative action.</p>
<p>The failure of the owner of <a href="http://iBaguette.com">iBaguette.com</a> or BaguetteBot to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed from the remainder of these Terms, which shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and the owner of <a href="http://iBaguette.com">iBaguette.com</a> and BaguetteBot’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
